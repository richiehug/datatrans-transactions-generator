# ðŸš€ Datatrans Transactions Generator

The **Datatrans Transactions Generator** is your ultimate tool for simulating transactions in Datatrans' test environment. Whether you're testing payment flows, debugging, or just having fun with transaction scenarios, this script has got you covered. Itâ€™s designed to be flexible and easy to use. Some bugs may occur, use at your own risk. Each request has a built-in delay to avoid overwhelming the servers. Be gentle with the Datatrans test environment. ðŸ‘€

## Features

- **Simulate Transactions**: Test authorization (auto & deferred capture), capture, cancel, top-up, and refund flows. This script lets you test customer-initiated and merchant-initiated transaction flows.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Define your merchant settings, payment methods, and transaction scenarios in JSON files.
- **CIT Transactions**: Test payment flows via our payment page headlessly.
- **CIT Flows for APMs**: Simulate Klarna, PayPal, and PostFinance Card transactions, with custom payloads if necessary.
- **Dynamic URLs**: Configure redirects and webhooks with `:refNo` placeholders for transaction-specific tracking.
- **Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC)**: Test DCC flows with supported cards (e.g., `5232050000010003`).
- **Decline Scenarios**: Test declines based on configurable amount ranges for each payment method.
- **Logging**: All transaction details are logged in a clean, structured format.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Tested with Node v18.17.1.
- Datatrans credentials: You will need at least one merchant configuration at your hand to run your tests. Be sure to know what payment methods and currencies are enabled.

## Installation

Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:

```sh
npm install
```

Navigate to the `app/config` folder, duplicate the desired configuration files, and remove the `_template*` part of the file names.

Configure your necessary tests and add the payment methods to be used during your tests.

## Run Script

Ready to roll? Run the script with:

```sh
node index.js
```

Make sure your JSON configuration files are set up correctly before running. If not, well, you know what to do. ðŸ˜‰

## Configuration

### `config.json`

This file defines your global and merchant configurations and the flows you want to test. Hereâ€™s what you can tweak:

| Global Parameter     | Description                                                                 | Type     |

### `payment_methods.json`

This file defines the payment methods youâ€™ll use for testing. Some flows may only be available if you specify a card with a decline range or 3DS codes.

If you are not an expert, start testing with the simple template. You just need to create a single transaction manually using `"createAlias":true` with both cards to receive a valid alias for that card. Once created, add it to your payment methods. The alias can be shared among your merchant configurations, as long as they are in the same Datatrans merchant group. The 'simple' cards already cover all test cases except DCC.

Your cards should at least contain one range for success cases, one range for decline cases and at least have once 3DS success and error codes defined. Non-card types are optional.

Hereâ€™s what you can configure:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                 | Type     |

| `alias`         | Payment method alias. Payment methods without alias will be ignored for MIT flows.                                                       | String   |

| `currencies`    | Supported currencies.                                                       | Array, String    |
| `transactionFlows.CIT` `transactionFlows.MIT`   | Supported transaction flows. If no flows are specified, all flows will be accepted.                                                      | Array, String    |

## Logs

Every test is logged with precision. Logs are stored in `app/logs`. Keep an eye on them to track your tests.
