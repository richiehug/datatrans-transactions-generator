# ðŸš€ Datatrans Transactions Generator

The **Datatrans Transactions Generator** is your ultimate tool for simulating transactions in Datatrans' test environment. Whether you're testing payment flows, debugging, or just having fun with transaction scenarios, this script has got you covered. Itâ€™s designed to be flexible and easy to use. Some bugs may occur, use at your own risk. Each request has a built-in delay (2-5 seconds) to avoid overwhelming the servers. Be gentle with the Datatrans test environment. ðŸ‘€

## Features

- **Simulate Transactions**: Test authorization (auto & deferred capture), capture, cancel, top-up, and refund flows.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Define your merchant settings, payment methods, and transaction scenarios in JSON files.
- **Decline Scenarios**: Test declines based on configurable amount ranges for each payment method.
- **Logging**: All transaction details are logged in a clean, structured format (`log.txt`).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Tested with Node v18.17.1.
- Datatrans credentials: You will need at least one merchant configuration at your hand to run your tests. Be sure to know what payment methods and currencies are enabled.

## Installation

1. Run the following command to install the required Node.js packages:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Navigate to the app/config folder, duplicate the configuration files, and remove the `_template` part of the file names.

3. Configure your necessary tests and add the payment methods to be used during your tests.

## Run Script

Ready to roll? Run the script with:

```sh
node index.js
```

Make sure your JSON configuration files are set up correctly before running. If not, well, you know what to do. ðŸ˜‰

## Available Tests

#### config.json Example

```json
{
